        Nice to meet you all, I am a Front-End Developer. I like to free draw,
        so getting creative ideas on a website is my speaciality. I also like
        everything when it comes to technology, so I am always learning new
        things. You can always say "Whats going to be the next big thing? and
        will we get Marty Mcfly's hoverboard?". I enjoyed codiung when I took my
        first class in college, and I have been doing it ever since. I am
        currently learning more about React and Javascript. I am also learning
        about the backend, so I can be a Full-Stack Developer. I am also
        learning about UI/UX design, so I can make my websites look more
        appealing. I am also learning about SEO, so I can make my websites more
        visible on the web. Web 3.0 will soon be here, so I am also learning
        about blockchain and cryptocurrency.
